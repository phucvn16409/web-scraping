# Project Name: Web Scraping with API and Web Driver in Google Colab

## Description
This project is a web scraping application that collects data from websites using both APIs and a web driver, and it is designed to run in Google Colab or Local Host. It utilizes API requests for data that is directly accessible via APIs and a web driver for data that requires rendering JavaScript or interactions with the website.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project in Google Colab, ensure you have the following:
- A Google Account to access Google Colab.
- Required Python libraries: Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium

## Usage in Google Colab
1. Open the Colab notebook (`scraping-usingAPI.ipynb`, `scraping-usingWebDriver.ipynb`) in Google Colab.
2. Make sure you have installed webdriver for your browser (Edge, Chrome,...)
3. Run the cells in the notebook to start the web scraping process.
4. The notebook will use APIs and web driver to collect data from the target websites.
5. The scraped data will be processed and saved in the Colab environment or Google Drive.

## Configuration
1. You can customize the Colab notebook (`scraping-usingAPI.ipynb`, `scraping-usingWebDriver.ipynb`) to change various settings such as API endpoints, web driver configurations, etc.
2. Add specific instructions or configurations to the Colab notebook based on your requirements.

## Additional Notes
- Mention any limitations or known issues when running the project in Google Colab.
- Provide guidance on how to handle authentication (if required) or other possible challenges.
